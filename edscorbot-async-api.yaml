    The ED Scorbot low level services definition for controlling an watching
    values from the Robotic arm. 


    ### Some useful links:

    * [Ed Scorbot Python]
    (https://github.com/RTC-research-group/Py-EDScorbotTool) - the Github
    projectcontaining the library (real implementation) of elementary/low level
    functions to access the robotic arm

    * [Ed Scorbot Documentation]
    (https://py-edscorbottool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - the user
    documentation/guide of the ED Scorbot tools (GUI, command line and detailed
    configurations). 

    ### Symbology

    * CONTROLLER = Arm's controller. The service responsible for receiving messages from clients, handling the physical arm and notifying clients. The controller guarantees the arm works accodring with its requirements.

    * CLIENT = Any application that wants to interact with the arm. In our case, this application is an Angular front-end to provide a friendly user experience to the final user (human).

    * We use a style where the information flows in channels from providers to subscribers.

    ### Communication Design

    The implemented controller follows a design in which topics are minimize. Tha is, a single topic is used to send information between providers and consumers in two directions. This reduces the mumber of channels/topics, but increases the implementation complexity in applications as they should communicate in a topic and handle the callback in the same topic. 


    Furthermore, to provide the possibility of connecting manhy controllers to a same broker, we include the `Robot Name` as prefix of the channel/topic. For example, let us adopt `EDScorbot` as the robot's name from now on. 

    #### Metainfo 

    The requests and the answers concerned with metainfo are encapsulated in the payload of the message (communicated through channel `EDScorbot/metainfo`). We distinguish which function or signal is sent/received using integers with the following semantics:

      * `ARM_GET_METAINFO` (value 1) - provided to clients to use to request the metainfo about all arms connected to the broker. CLIENTS (publishers) send this function request to the CONTROLLER (subscriber)

      * `ARM_METAINFO` (value 2) - provided to CONTROLLERS inform the metainfo of their associated physical arms. CONTROLLERS (publishers) sends this data to the CLIENTS (subscribers)


      #### Functions 

      The functions and the answers exchanged between clients and the controller are encapsulated in the payload of the message (communicate through channel `EDScorbot/commands`). We distinguish which function or signal is sent/received using integers wose semantics is as follows:

      * `ARM_CHECK_STATUS` (value 3) - provided to CLIENTS use to check the status of the arm. CLIENTS (publishers) send this function request to the CONTROLLER (subscriber)

      * `ARM_STATUS` (value 4) - provided to the CONTROLLER inform the current status of the arm. CONTROLLER (publisher) sends this data to the CLIENTS (subscribers)

     * `ARM_CONNECT` (value 5) - provided to CLIENTS use to connect to the arm, so they can become owners. If the arm is available, the controller promotes on client to `owner` and notifies all clients about it. CLIENTS (publishers) send this function request to the CONTROLLER (subscriber)

      * `ARM_CONNECTED` (value 6) - provided to the CONTROLLER inform which client has successfully connected to the arm and became its `owner`. Only one client can be the amr's owner at a time. By the message content, client are able to know if they have been rejected as owner. CONTROLLER (publisher) sends this data to the CLIENTS (subscribers)

      * `ARM_DISCONNECT` (value 7) - provided to allow arm's owner (CLIENT) to `release` the arm. CLIENTS (publishers) send this function request to the CONTROLLER (subscriber)
        
      * `ARM_MOVE_TO_POINT` (value 8) - provided to allow the owner to move the arm in a point by point interaction. CLIENTS (publishers) send this function request to the CONTROLLER (subscriber)


      * `ARM_APPLY_TRAJECTORY` (value 9) - provided to allow arm's owner to send a trajectory to the controller. A trajectory is a sequence of points and its execution respects the order of the points. Each point represents a single movement to be executed by the robot. CLIENTS (publishers) send this function request to the CONTROLLER (subscriber)

      * `ARM_CANCEL_TRAJECTORY` (value 10) - provided to allow arm's owner to cancel a trajectory execution at any time. The arm stops in the last point and communicates it. CLIENTS (publishers) send this function request to the CONTROLLER (subscriber)

  'EDScorbot/metainfo':
    description: Channel/topic provided to allow communication of metainfo. CLIENTS use to request arm's metainfo. We use a design in which different CONTROLLERS can be registered in the broker. Thus, they respond this message and CLIENTS can choose which arm to interact with. This design makes possible to connect a same client application with different arms.
